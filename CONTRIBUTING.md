> How to help organize issues and maintain consistency when reporting, contributing, and requesting features

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues. Most labels are used across all of Adriftus Studios. 

GitHub search makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in. For example, you might be interested in open issues which are labeled bugs but haven't been reviewed yet, or open issues for feature requests.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.
